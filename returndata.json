\"read into\" one's social and laboral status through elaborate clothing and accessories. religious motifs were also common in the clothing, due to its important influence. motifs such as rosaries, crosses and images of saints were commonly found, especially in women's dresses, because modesty and purity were seen as fundamental feminine traits. along with this, gender roles were a fundamental value of the society, so men wore loose-fitting garments with intricate details, while women wore more restrictive clothing that traditionally represented modesty. another important key feature of the fashion worn during the spanish golden age were the regional and historical influences. since spain was a recently unified country at the time, pretty all the regions had pretty distinct cultural backgrounds (for example; the castilians, aragonese, granadians/andalusians, catalans, basques, navarrans, galicians, asturians, leonese, valencians, etc. - all of these regions had their differences due to the fact they were distinct kingdoms before unification), and this obviously contributed to the sense of fashion in spain during the 16th and 17th century. the north of spain was stereotypically considered to be more modest, conservative, religious and 'cultured', while the south of spain was considered romantic and warm. southern fashion also included north african and
